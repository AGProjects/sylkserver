Roadmap
-------

- [webrtcgateway] Bridge SIP end-points to WebRTC conference (audio only)
- [webrtcgateway] Replace Sofia stack with SIP SIMPLE client SDK

Contact list application (XCAP to JS api).  This application must export a
Javascript API that can be used by a WebRTC client to manage a contact list
stored on an XCAP server.


Improvements
------------

- Change disabled_applications to active_applications which accepts a list
  which can contain the keyword ALL and [+/-]app_name tokens
- For debian check if we can use the snakeoil cert from the ssl-cert package


Fixes
-----

- Handle 183 progress event from janus which contains an SDP, while the
  later accepted event won't.
