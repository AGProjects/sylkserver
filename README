Description
-----------

SylkServer is an extensible SIP Application Server.

SylkServer allows creation and delivery of rich multimedia applications
accessed by SIP User Agents.  The server supports SIP signaling over TLS,
TCP and UDP transports, RTP and MSRP media planes, has built in capabilities
for creating ad-hoc SIP multimedia conferences with wideband Audio, IM and
File Transfer and can be easily extended with other applications by using
Python programming language.

Built-in Applications
---------------------

1. Conference

SylkServer allows SIP end-points to create ad-hoc conference rooms by
sending INVITE to a random username at the hostname or domain where the
server runs.  Other participants can then join by sending an INVITE to the
same SIP URI used to create the room.  The INVITE and subsequent re-INVITE
methods may contain one or more media types supported by the server.  Each
conference room mixed audio, instant messages and uploded files are
dispatched to all participants.

One can remove or add participants by sending a REFER method to the
conference URI.

If a participant sends a file to the SIP URI of the room, the server will
accept it, store it for the duration of the conference and offer it to all
participants either present at that moment, or later to those that have
joined the conference at a later moment.
