Description
-----------

SylkServer is a state of the art, extensible SIP Application Server

SylkServer allows creation and delivery of rich multimedia applications
accessed by SIP User Agents.  The server supports SIP signaling over TLS,
TCP and UDP transports, RTP and MSRP media planes, has built in capabilities
for creating ad-hoc SIP multimedia conferences with HD Audio, IM and File
Transfer and can be easily extended with other applications by using Python
programming language.

Built-in Applications
---------------------

1. Conferencing

SylkServer allows SIP end-points to create ad-hoc conference rooms by
sending INVITE to a random username at the hostname or domain where the
server runs.  Other participants can then join by sending an INVITE to the
same SIP URI used to create the room.  The INVITE and subsequent re-INVITE
methods may contain one or more media types supported by the server.  Each
conference room mixed audio, instant messages and uploded files are
dispatched to all participants.

SIP end-points that do not support MSRP chat can join the bridge by using
audio only, they will receive the chat messages over the SIP signaling using
SIP MESSAGE method, which is supported by many legacy end-points.  Messages
sent to the room using SIP MESSAGE will be dispatched by either SIP MESSAGE
or through established MSRP sessions depending on how the end-points have
joined the room.

If a participant sends a file to the SIP URI of the room, the server will
accept it, store it for the duration of the conference and offer it to all
participants either present at that moment, or later to those that have
joined the conference at a later moment.
