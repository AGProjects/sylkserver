Description
-----------

SylkServer is a SIP application server that can be programmed to perform SIP
end-point applications.

The server supports SIP signaling over TLS, TCP and UDP transports, RTP and
MSRP media planes, has built in capabilities for creating ad-hoc SIP
multimedia conferences with HD Audio, IM and File Transfer and can be easily
extended with other applications by using Python language.


Deployment
----------

SylkServer must be typically deployed behind a SIP Proxy for providing such
functions. SylkServer is not designed to transparently route packets,
authorization, accounting and handle NAT traversal for signaling or media.
Performing applications like SIP Proxy, Registrar, or Presence Agent are out
of its scope.

SylkServer is horizontally scalable with the amount of available hardware by
using SIP Thor, a P2P based self-organizing network technology.

Built-in Applications
---------------------

1. Conference

SylkServer allows SIP end-points to create ad-hoc conference rooms by
sending INVITE to a random username at the hostname or domain where the
server runs.  Other participants can then join by sending an INVITE to the
same SIP URI used to create the room.  The INVITE and subsequent re-INVITE
methods may contain one or more media types supported by the server.  Each
conference room mixed audio, instant messages and uploded files are
dispatched to all participants.

One can remove or add participants by sending a REFER method to the
conference URI.

If a participant sends a file to the SIP URI of the room, the server will
accept it, store it for the duration of the conference and offer it to all
participants either present at that moment, or offer it on demand to those
that have joined the conference at a later moment.
